# DBM-Winter edit by Maevis
A version of WotLK DBM with accurate timers for Winter-WoW server. Please see the Release tab to find the latest stable version.

# Changelog 
#### General Notes
* Timings are based on personal experience, vods, and logs of other guilds on Winter. 
* Due to some form of spell batching / spell queuing, there is a small amount of randomness on a lot of boss abilities. 
* Most of these are marked as CDs
* For example: Frost Blast on Kel'Thuzad, Locust Swarm (Cast, not the duration) on Anub'Rekhan, Noth's first Blink, and Eonar's Gift are the most random.

  * Adjusted adds spawn timers to be more accurate
  * Adjusted the first dominate mind timer to be more accurate
  * * Ability is being used anywhere between 40 and 48 seconds so use it as a cooldown reset timer
  * Added the option to enable automatic removal of Mark/Gift of the Wild after 24 seconds of combat
  * * The 24 second delay is so that the buff is still active during first trinket uptime
  * * This option is enabled by default for dps and healers
